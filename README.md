## ⚙️ Data Preparation Challenges  

During development, I encountered several real-world data challenges:
- **Messy & unstructured data** with missing values and inconsistent merchant names.  
- **Overlapping fraud categories** requiring logical mapping and standardization.  
- **Complex DAX measures** to accurately compute *fraud rate*, *critical risk %*, and *total fraud score*.  
- Achieving **visual balance** — ensuring visuals not only looked aesthetic but answered the *right business questions*.  

Through iterative refinement and testing, I achieved a dashboard that delivers **clarity, accuracy, and business impact**.
